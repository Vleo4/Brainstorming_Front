                Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a biologically active chemical
                substance that transmits an emotional response in the human
                brain and allows you to feel pleasure and not feel pain. It is
                also a neurotransmitter responsible for movement, so it is
                produced in certain brain cells that control muscle activity.
              </p>
              <p className="h5">
                Dopamine causes feelings of happiness and euphoria. Dopamine is
                also one of the main components of the biochemical mechanism of
                falling in love — the brain of a person in love begins to
                rapidly produce dopamine. An increase in the concentration of
                dopamine is observed during the consumption of pleasant-tasting
                food or work for a good reward. The use of addictive substances:
                alcohol, nicotine or cocaine temporarily increases the
                concentration of dopamine in the brain. Those who suffer from
                depression have low levels. Also, the lack of dopamine leads to
                slowing down and retardation of cognitive processes in the human
                brain, stiffness of movements, difficulty walking, and
                limitation of motor activity.

                Dopamine is a vital substance, the lack of which causes poor
                health (depressed emotional state) and also leads to very
                serious disorders of movement and muscle activity (for example,
                Parkinson's disease).

                In addition to its neurotransmitter properties in the central
                nervous system, dopamine acts as a hormone. It has a specific
                effect on the function of the cardiovascular system — it
                increases systolic blood pressure as a result of stimulation of
                α-adrenoceptors, increases the strength of heart contractions as
                a result of stimulation of β-adrenoceptors, increases cardiac
                output and heart rate. Dopamine also causes dilatation of kidney
                vessels, increases diuresis and natriuresis, increases the
                synthesis of prostaglandins by kidney tissue, and stimulates the
                exocrine function of the pancreas.

                The prefrontal cortex (Cortex praefrontalis) is a section of the
                cortex of the large hemispheres of the brain, which is the front
                part of the frontal lobes.
              </p>
              <p className="h5">
                This part of the brain ensures the planning of complex cognitive
                behavior, the expression of personality, decision-making, and
                the regulation of social behavior. The main purpose is the
                coordination of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal
                goals. A typical psychological term for the functions performed
                by the prefrontal cortex is executive function. It is associated
                with the ability to identify conflicting thoughts, predict
                future consequences of current actions (good and bad, good and
                better, same and different), act towards a certain goal, predict
                outcomes, action-based expectations, and social "control" (the
                ability to suppress thoughts that may lead to socially
                unacceptable results).

                The basic function of the prefrontal cortex is the complex
                control of mental and motor activity in accordance with internal
                goals and plans. It plays a major role in the creation of
                complex cognitive schemes and action plans, decision-making,
                control and regulation of both internal activity and social
                behavior and interaction. The control functions of the
                prefrontal cortex are manifested in the differentiation of
                conflicting thoughts and motives and the choice between them,
                differentiation and integration of objects and concepts,
                prediction of the consequences of real activity and its
                adjustment in accordance with the desired result, emotional
                regulation, volitional control, concentration of attentionon
                necessary objects.

                The goal of our program is the artificial release of dopamine
                with the help of physical and arithmetical exercises. To develop
                the prefrontal cortex, we use simple and effective arithmetic
                examples. Based on an experiment conducted at Tohoku University,
                we selected the most effective exercises. The essence of this
                practical experiment was to find out which exercises activate
                the activity of the brain, and in our program you will find only
                those exercises that have proven their effectiveness. During
                this experiment, volunteers who performed arithmetic exercises
                were monitored for changes in cerebral blood circulation using
                optical topography. His results shocked the entire scientific
                community: compared to a state of rest, during problem-solving,
                blood circulation in the brain improves and brain activity
                becomes more active. In our program you will find problems that
                contain one unknown number, as well as magic squares and many
                other interesting exercises. You will also find physical
                exercises there that will help you keep your body in good shape.
                Exercise is one of the best activities for the brain and body.
                Exercising increases endorphin levels: an improvement in mood
                can be observed after just 10 minutes of aerobic activity, such
                as long-distance running at a moderate pace, and after 20
                minutes it reaches its peak. Although these effects are not
                directly related to dopamine fluctuations, animal studies do
                suggest that exercise can increase dopamine levels in the brain.
                For example, running on a treadmill increased the release of
                dopamine in rats and regulated the number of dopamine receptors
                in areas of the brain responsible for reward.
